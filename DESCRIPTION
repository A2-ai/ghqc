Description: This package launches 3 ghqc applications as background jobs to 
  aid the QC process through the use of shiny apps. It also contains aides to 
  maintain the proper setup of the ecosystem. Namely, it will aide in the 
  installation of ghqc.apps and its dependendencies into an isolated directory as
  to not interfere with the project being QC'ed.
